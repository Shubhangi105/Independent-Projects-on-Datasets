# LoanPrediction
The assignment consisted of a dataset to be analysed, and machine learning models to be
applied on it and model interpretation to be done, finally. The objective was to build a model
to predict if a customer would be approved/rejected for a loan application based on the details
provided by them. These details would be their gender, marital status, education, the number
of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, amongst others. 
On the basis of these factors, the applicant was signalled ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ for Loan Approval.
The above dataset is what is referred to as a supervised dataset, and consequently, the
appropriate machine learning models must be applied on it. I applied Decision Tree, Random
Forest, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression, to get a final accuracy of 86% and a F1
score of 90%. The dataset is given above

# MovieRecommendationSystem

The dataset was given of imbd movie, along with their ratings and description. The dataset can be found here.https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
I used Demographic Filtering and content based filtering and found content based filtering to be a much better option. 
In this notebook I built a baseline Movie Recommendation System using TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. For novices like me this notebook will pretty much serve as a foundation in recommendation systems and will provide you with something to start with.
